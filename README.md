# Daytona Guides

Runnable, self-contained examples showing how to build AI agents, data analysts, model-serving endpoints, and reinforcement-learning workflows on [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io) sandboxes.

Each guide lives in its own folder with its own README, dependencies, and `.env.example`. Most guides also have a step-by-step walkthrough in the [Daytona docs](https://www.daytona.io/docs/en/guides).

## Prerequisites

- A **Daytona account** and **API key** — create one in the [Daytona Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys).
- The runtime the guide uses — **Python** or **Node.js**. Minimum versions vary by guide (baseline Python 3.10+ / Node.js 18+, though some need newer, e.g. Python 3.12 or Node.js 22), so check the guide's own README.
- Any provider API keys a given guide needs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) — see that guide's README.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daytona/guides.git
cd guides/<path-to-guide>      # e.g. typescript/openai/codex-sdk

cp .env.example .env           # then fill in your keys
```

Then follow the guide's own README to install dependencies and run it.

## Contributing

Each guide is self-contained — keep changes scoped to a single guide's folder, include a clear README, and provide a `.env.example` for any required keys. Every commit needs a [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) sign-off (`git commit -s`), and first-time contributors sign the [CLA](CLA.md). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full process.

## Security

Security policy and vulnerability reporting are maintained in the organization-wide [Daytona security policy](https://github.com/daytona/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md). Please report vulnerabilities through the channels described there — not through public issues.
